# Tasks for Quantum Graph Neural Networks for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC

The project description can be found [here](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/projects/2023/project_QMLHEP.html) and the corresponding tasks are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqBGbH44Eu3W432oRxpOCfI5Dy2pgh2E21JcHeD0fng/edit)

File names are self sufficient to identify the tasks. Below are the clickable file links for each task.

- [Task I: Quantum Computing Part](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks-2023/blob/main/Task%20I.ipynb)
- [Task II: Classical Graph Neural Network (GNN)](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks-2023/blob/main/Task%20II.ipynb)
- [Task III: Open Task](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks-2023/blob/main/Task%20III.md)
- [Task V: Quantum Graph Neural Network (QGNN)](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale/QMLHEP-Tasks-2023/tree/main/Task_V)

We also tried to classify [Electron-Photon showers](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1085/4/042022/pdf) using classical GNNs. This was done to understand the process of creation of graph representation of images.[Graph Variational Autoencoder for Detector Reconstruction and Fast Simulation in High-Energy Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01725) (2021) by A. Hariri et al. (including S. Gleyzer) was used as inspiration.
